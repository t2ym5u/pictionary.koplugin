# pictionary.koplugin

A **Pictionary Party** display plugin for [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) — put your e-reader in the middle of the table and play Pictionary with pen and paper.

## Concept

Teams take turns. The drawer receives the device, sees the word in secret, then draws it on paper while teammates guess. A countdown timer runs. One tap records the result, scores update automatically, and play passes to the next team.

No typing during the game — just the drawer and the device, everyone else watches the paper.

## Rules

- Teams take turns. The drawer sees the word in secret and draws it on paper; no speaking, no gestures.
- Teammates guess while the timer runs.
- **✓ Got it!** — tap to award +1 to the drawing team.
- **✗ Missed** — 0 points; play passes to the next team.
- First team to reach the agreed score wins.

## Features

- **Secret word reveal** — teammates look away while the drawer taps *Show the word*
- **Countdown timer** — 45 s, 1 min, 1:30 or 2 min (configurable)
- **Auto-scored** — ✓ Got it / ✗ Missed advances the team tracker automatically
- **Built-in word bank** — 480 words across 8 categories × 3 difficulties (FR + EN)
- **Category & difficulty filters** — Animals, Food, Sport, Objects… Easy / Medium / Hard / Mixed
- **2–6 teams** — configurable team count
- **E-ink friendly** — only the timer digit refreshes in fast/A2 mode
